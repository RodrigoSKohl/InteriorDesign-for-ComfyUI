### This node is still under development

This node only work on `transformers>=4.39.0,<=4.45.0`



This node adapts [StableDesign: 2nd place solution for the Generative Interior Design 2024 competition](https://huggingface.co/spaces/MykolaL/StableDesign) to use directly on ComfyUI.

The pipeline automatically downloads custom models of `controlnet_depth` and `own_controlnet` to the local repository. Other models are downloaded to the `.cache` folder of Hugging Face.
